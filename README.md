# Nico
This exercise, explored the fundamentals of HTML and CSS while fostering team collaboration. I designed and built an "About Me" page for Nico Lewis. This project promotes design, development, and teamwork skills, with a focus on creating responsive and visually appealing layouts.

After speaking with Nico, I felt compelled to highlight her strengths, as she’s a hardworking individual who often feels overlooked. To reflect her passion for collaboration and learning, the website opens with a quote that embodies these values. I wanted to share her journey through the "My Journey" section, capturing the essence of her professional and personal growth. To showcase her community involvement, I included a list of the organizations she’s a part of, highlighting her commitment to connecting with others. Since this website is semi-professional, I also added some fun facts to give visitors a deeper, more personal glimpse into Nico’s life.

Photos were incorporated to enhance the visual appeal, creating a striking yet simple and clean design that complements the overall aesthetic of the site.
