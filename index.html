<h1>My Journey</h1>
<br>
<p>For years, I found myself navigating the vast world of software development, searching for my place. Despite challenges and initial setbacks, I was determined to continue building, experimenting, and exploring. I’ve freelanced, participated in boot camps, and even worked in DevOps and AWS Certified SysOps. I’ve held roles from web developer to product manager, and I’m always looking for new ways to grow, learn, and evolve.
    After attending meetups around NYC, I discovered developer relations—a field that perfectly blends engineering with communication and community building. The “Black Rel” meetup group, specifically focused on African American developer relations, opened my eyes to the power of storytelling, advocacy, and supporting developers with the tools they need to thrive.
    While I love the thrill of coding, I also crave the freedom to be creative and to break the mold. I want to build tools that matter, not only for developers but for the people behind the code.
  <br>
  <br>
    I’m excited about what’s to come—whether it's joining a dream company like Google or collaborating with innovative teams that push the boundaries of technology. No matter where the journey takes me, I’m determined to build something that lasts, using my failures as fuel and always striving for the next level.
        Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or talk shop about developer relations, tech, or anything in between!
